## Overview

CamUI for picamera2 is a lightweight web interface for the Raspberry Pi camera module, built on the picamera2 Python library and using Flask. This project provides a user interface to configure camera settings, capture photos, and manage images in a basic gallery.

### Old Demo

New Demo video will be coming soon!

(If you would like to see the old demo its down below)

## Features

- **Camera Control:** Easily configure camera settings such as image rotation, exposure, white balance settings, and many more. Take control of your Raspberry Pi Camera and instantly see the feedback!
- **Capture Photos:** Take photos with a single click and save them to the image gallery!
- **Image Gallery:** View, edit, delete, and download your images in a simple gallery interface.
- **Use the stream url:** Video and Snapshot URL's are available to use in applications like OBS, VLC, Home assistent and Octoprint
- **Multi Camera Support!:** If you are on a Raspberry Pi5 you can connect 2 cameras at the same time CamUI supports using both at the same time
 
## Whats new from the old Picamera2 WebUI

This project was formarally known as 'Picamera2 WebUI' but the name made me feel that it was an edit of picamera2 which its not, its a extra control layer that pulls at picamera2's strings. 

- **App Name:** Its now CamUI for picamera2
- **More effecant code:** Now v2 of CamUI will load faster and deal with camera issues better and can be maintained more easilly if more settings are added to picamera2
- **Desktop and Mobile mode:** You can choose which template to use that suits your need. New Mobile mode means you get a more touch friendly UI!
- **Settings all in one place:** Sensor mode has been moved to the camera controls so everything is together.
- **Capture higher resolution images:** Before images where captured from the video feed. Now there will be a switch in camera modes when capturing photos meaning you get the maximum resoltuion and quality even when your video stream is set to low.
- **Basic Edit mode in Image Gallery:** If you need to rotate or tweak your image after the fact, you can now do that with some basic edit options in the image gallery
- **Fetching Metadata:** fetching sensor metadata is now possible.
- **Removed feature - GPIO:** GPIO has been removed from this version as it needs more work done to get this feature right.

## What is Picamera2 Library

This project utilizes the Picamera2 Python library. Picamera2 is the libcamera-based replacement for Picamera which was a Python interface to the Raspberry Pi's legacy camera stack.

## Getting Started

Note: Please also see [Compatibility](#compatibilty) below

### Preinstalls / Dependencies

As of September 2024 the Bookworm version of Raspberry Pi OS (Desktop) has the required dependencies preinstalled, so you can skip to **Installation** below. If you are using the Lite version you will need to install the following:
- [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/#install-flask)
- [Picamera2](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2)

### Installation

1. Update Raspberry Pi OS: 
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
2. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/monkeymademe/picamera2-WebUI.git
```
3. Enter the directory: 
```bash
cd picamera2-WebUI
```
4. Run the application and access the web interface through your browser.
```bash
python app.py
```
5. From your broswer, on a device connected to the same network, goto the following address: 'http://**Your IP**:8080/'

## Running as a service 

- Run the following command and note down the location for python which python should look like "/usr/bin/python" `which python`
- Goto the following directory `cd /etc/systemd/system/`
- Create and edit the following file `sudo nano picamera2-webui.service`
- Paste this into the file, in the line "ExecStart" the 1st part should be the result of your "which python" command we did at the start (if its the same then its all good) the 2nd path is the location of the cloned repo with the app.py
  
```bash
[Unit]
Description=CamUI Server
After=network.target
[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/pi/CamUI/app.py
Restart=always
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
- Save the file
- Run `sudo systemctl start picamera2-webui.service` to start the service 
- Run the following to check the service is running `sudo systemctl status picamera2-webui.service`
- Run the following to enable the service to its running on reboot `sudo systemctl enable picamera2-webui.service`
  
## Compatibilty

- **Raspberry Pi OS / Debian**

Please be aware that due to dependencies on newer versions of Picamera2 (see below) and Libcamera this project only works on Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm (or newer). Issues have been reported with older versions (e.g. Bullseye) not functioning due to libcamera no longer being updated on older versions of the Raspberry Pi OS. The recommendation, even on older Pi's, is to use Bookworm (or newer).

- **Picamera2**

Please check [Picamera installation Requirements](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). Your operating system may not be compatible with Picamera2.

There has been some reported issues with the PiCamera2 on older Raspberry Pi's: ```OSError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory``` https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/issues/972#issuecomment-1980573868

- **Hardware**

Tested on Raspberry Pi Camera Module v3 which has focus settings. v1 is untested but if you see any bugs please post an issue. v2 and HQ has been tested settings like Auto focus that are unique to Camera Module v3 are filtered and removed when an older camera is used.

Raspberry Pi Compatibilty: 

- Pi 5 (8GB): Perfect
- Pi 5 (4GB): Perfect
- Pi 4 (4GB): Perfect
- Pi 3B: Perfect
- Pi Zero v2: Slower lower frame rate on feed but very useable
- Pi Zero v1: Untested
- Older Pi's (Model A, 2B etc): Untested but expected not to work well.

## Known issues 

- ScalerCrop is not working correctly
- Saving config is currently optimal and will be reworked for the next release
